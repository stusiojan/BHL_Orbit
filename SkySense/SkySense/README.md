#  Demo app

For demo purpuses star posisions are mocked in `data.swift` and audio_files in `Resources/`

Otherwise we would use ours sercives to get:
- star posisions
- some quick LLM model response from RAG with curated stars data ( f. ex. Gemini Flash 1.5, GPT o1 mini)
- generate audio files with ElevenLabs

So user can get informative answer to every question that occurs.
