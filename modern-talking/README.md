What were original followup questions?

- mars - "If Mars once had rivers and oceans, where did all the water go? Could it ever return?"
- venus - "If Venus is so hostile, how could we ever hope to explore her, let alone understand her mysteries?"
- big dipper - "You speak of these stars with such reverence, but are they truly eternal, or will the Big Dipper too vanish someday?"
- cassiopeia - "You spoke of the Heart Nebula within Cassiopeiaâ€”what makes it so special, and can we truly glimpse its secrets from here on Earth?"
